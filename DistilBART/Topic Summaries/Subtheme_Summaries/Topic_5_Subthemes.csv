Green Building Design,Materials Sustainable Construction,"The study suggests a way to assess the environmental cost and building cost in the structural design process of buildings . The study was conducted by researchers from the University of Australia . It found that an appropriate selecting of construction forms and type of construction form can save up to 5% of the cost of material consumption, 5%. The study found that the office building designed with lightweight construction method (waffle slab and normal concrete has a lower life cycle cost (50 year lifespan) in comparison with the other design alternatives. The results show that the new building was found to have a lower. was. the. office building has a higher life cycle costs. in compared with the others in comparison. It was found that it can save. 5-e.

Green Building Design,Norway Building Upgrades,"Norway Building Upgrades: the upgrading of building infrastructure to modern standards represents a key tool for reducing global energy demand and emissions from buildings . Building upgrades have been prioritized despite the relatively low carbon intensity of the norwegian energy mix . Up to 90% of the existing norwegian building stock is expected to remain standing by the year 2050 . The findings should inform construction industry participants of the significant potential in reducing the embodied energy of high-rise office buildings in high- Rise office buildings. The paper. The findings will also help the construction industry and local government participants. The report should also be used to help build a public transport network and improve town planning and planning to improve city planning and city planning for the city of Lebanon, Leban.

Green Building Design,Environmental Performance Green,"This study explores environmental performances and sustainable development benefits of green wall systems . It aims to contribute to the knowledge on the environmental performance of green walls . The australian solution is characterized by the lowest global warming emission (64.7 kgco2eq) compared to 163.2 and 144.9 kgco 2eq of the other solutions but also by an impact reduction across all categories, attributed to use of eco-friendly materials and production techniques. The study revealed significant context-specific differences. The paper includes also issues regarding the evolution of the examined footprint. The report also includes issues regarding. the evolution. of the examine footprint within the next years, including the various greek national policies and measures that have been announced and started to be realized.

Green Building Design,Residential Carbon Emissions,"Study: Building stock provides favorable material and welfare support to the urbanization process, but also triggers significant resource extraction and carbon emissions . The absence of spatial distribution of emissions undermines support to regional carbon reduction initiatives . The study aims to investigate how embodied carbon assessment is affected by different variables and what the exact numerical influences are . It offers insights for cross-boundary ecosystem governance and regional circular economy development. The study provides a theoretical foundation. The calculation of embodied impacts requires rigorous, flexible and comprehensive assessment tools. The analysis of embodied greenhouse gas and greenhouse gas (ghg (ghG) emissions across these scales is becoming more important to support this direction. the calculation of embodying impacts is become more important. The tool can be used in the calculation.

Green Building Design,Renewable Energy Desalination,"Study compares three desalination based alternatives for water supply in off-grid areas . The three options are: a solar still, a photo-voltaic (pv) powered reverse osmosis (ro) unit, and water delivery by truck from a central ro plant . Of the three options, pv-ro is found to have the least environmental impact. of the three Options, pV-ro was found to has the least. of. the most effective. of these options. The study. of the three option, p v. was found. was the most environmentally-friendly. The paper was published in the Journal of Environmental Studies (Lca) and was published on October 23, 2011.

Green Building Design,Designers Environmental Impacts,"The aim of this paper is to evaluate whether the life cycle assessment methodology, which is rarely applied to an event, can be an appropriate tool for calculating the environmental impacts associated with the assembly, disassembly, and use phase of an event . A small event held in northern italy was selected as the subject of the research . The main contributors are energy consumption for lighting and heating and the use of aluminium materials. The results show that for each of the five different classes, the support, lining and infrastructure works. The support and infrastructure. works account for at least 70% of the impact in each environmental impact categories. The study shows that the support and Infrastructure works represent almost the entire environmental impact for the s-iii class, with an average of.

Green Building Design,Modeling Lca Building,"Digital technologies such as building information modelling (bim) have also been explored to generate and manage data through the lifecycle of buildings . The study aims to develop a bim-based lca method for prefabricated buildings incorporating different assessment levels with unique system boundaries and functional units . The developed approach can support automated assessments through all lifecycle phases of a prefabRICated building. It is achieved through an automated process. It can be used. It. is achieved. It was achieved through the automated process of using lca. and the. to. and other. lca and other parameters to merge lca data into the building model, systematic zoning, model setup and impact estimation. This approach is applied to evaluate.

Green Building Design,Construction Activities Uncertainty,"A multi-method-based uncertainty analysis framework was developed in view of the basic characteristics of the construction practice . Results showed that the uncertainties in the measurement method and geographic representativeness are the major uncertainty sources for the building construction phase . The total greenhouse gas emission for the target building was 8791.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent with a 9.8% coefficient of variation, which was in line with the result calculated and extrapolated. The results of the scenario analysis shows that the proportion of. the result of the. was in. the results showed that. the coefficient of variations of 18% in uncertainty analysis can be regarded as the baseline for determining the critical input parameters, which is in line. The proportion of 1% in.

Green Building Design,Solar Water Heater,"Study presents simulation tool for the design optimization of integrated collector storage (ics) solar water heaters using a prototype solar device as reference . The paper presents the study of a hybrid photovoltaic/thermal solar water system installed on the roof of buildings . The study shows that hybrid systems are more efficient compared to conventional solar thermal and photovolaic appliances, while they are less environmentally friendly. Switching to renewable energy is key to reducing greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions from building energy systems. The resheat systems show significant environmental impacts. The study also shows that the Resheat systems are the highest contributor to ozone layer depletion and the refrigerant inside the pump is the highest contributors to ozone Layer depletion. The results show that the.

Green Building Design,Carbon Embodied Buildings,"Concrete, timber and ceramic tiles are the three major energy expensive materials involved . concrete alone consumes 65% of the total embodied energy of the home while its share of environmental impacts is even more crucial . In this study we have analysed the life cycle primary energy and greenhouse gas (ghg) balances of concrete-frame and timber-frame multi-storey building alternatives . The energy recovered is assumed to replace fossil coal or gas. The Energy recovered is presumed to replace. the energy recovered. The energy and ghg flows in the energy. is assumed. to replace Fossil coal.
