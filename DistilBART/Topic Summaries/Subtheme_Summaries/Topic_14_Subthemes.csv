Modified Asphalt Mixtures,Rubberized Asphalts Investigated,"A new analysis framworke is developed to separate the confounding effect in the Hamburg Wheel-Track (HWT) test, hence the influence of moisture can be exclusively quantified. The study attempts to investigate the moisture resistance of rubberized asphalt using two novel evaluation methods. The results suggest that conventional bonding strength and TSR indicators cannot discriminate different types of rubberised asphalts and show a low correlation with each other. The new HWT analysis further improves the TSR indicators. The results of the new analysis Frame further improves. The study. was. inventors and the results of these new methods. The research was carried out on bitumen binder of VG."
Modified Asphalt Mixtures,Modified Asphalt,"The study proposes a strategy for cost-effective and environmentally friendly modification of fiber surface . The lignin in bf, which affects the tensile strength of fibers, is dissolved by a deep eutectic solvent (DES) system, and then the lignin is reborn on the surface of the fibers with the assistance of tannic acid based on the hydrophobicity and free radical trapping properties of lignins.  The results show that bpf can greatly maintain or even improve the performance of asphalt binder. The work introduces a simple and practical strategy for enhancing the interaction between BF and asphalt. The optimum amount is 10 %."
Modified Asphalt Mixtures,Rap Sustainable Concrete,"The paper aims to understand the feasibility and constraints of rap-concrete usage in concrete pavements. Reclaimed asphalt pavement from the demolished flexible pavement, referred to as rap, has been widely experimented with as a potential replacement for pristine aggregates (both coarse and fine aggregate) The paper discusses the WMA technology, its classification, mix design guidelines for WMA, use of RAP and reclaimed asphalt shingles (RAS)."
Modified Asphalt Mixtures,Fracture Behaviour Asphalt,"The study looked at the short- and long-term cracking behavior of asphalt pavement under tensile and tear deformations. The study's results will aid in developing sustainable pavement options, including RAP and PET, from both an economic and environmental standpoint. The goal of this study is to evaluate the mechanical properties of asphalt concrete made with 100% RAP aggregate and crushed polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles. The effect of adding PET to rap aggregate was investigated with PET contents ranging from 0% to 1.0% by weight of RAP aggregate. "
Modified Asphalt Mixtures,Waste Masks Asphalt,The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated the demand for disposable masks to an unprecedented level. This paper proposed to recycle the waste mask fiber (MF) in combination with the waste cooking oil (WCO) for hot mix asphalt (HMA) application. The incorporation of MF + WCO can significantly improve the high-temperature rutting resistance performance of asphalt binder. The addition of WCO was found to compensate for this low-temperature anti-cracking.
Modified Asphalt Mixtures,Pothole Repair Asphalt,"Cold patching materials (CPMs) have become a preferred choice for pothole repair on asphalt pavements in cold and wet weather. The survival time of conventional CPMs is not satisfactory enough, while the advanced (probably more expensive) CPMs that can achieve longer repair longevity may be more cost-effective in the long term. The study investigated the feasibility of rejuvenating aged bitumen using bio-based rejuvenators. The rejuvenator exhibited excellent regeneration performance and a high diffusion coefficient in the aged asphalt-binder. The results showed that the rejuvenator had good storage stability and a low diffusion coefficient. The result showed the rejuvenators showed that a rejuvenator could be evenly mixture of the old and old asphalt- binder could..."
Modified Asphalt Mixtures,Waste Plastics Asphalt,"The study compares the environmental benefits and burdens of the application of reprocessed plastics (RPS) in asphalt mixtures in the dry process compared with those of commercial polymers. The use of waste plastics as binder additives is an alternative to commercial polymers, which can contribute to solving problems related to waste management. The study aims to increase the incorporation of RA and other waste materials in the production of recycled asphalt mixture. The study was concluded that up to 7.5% of UMO and 4.0% of HDPE. The reuse and recycling of reclaimed asphalt. is becoming common practice, but needs further research."
Modified Asphalt Mixtures,Pet Modified Bitumen,"The applicability of PET as a modifier for bitumen has been hindered by PET's low compatibility with bitumen . In this study, PET flakes were functionalized by grafting bio-oils onto their surface. This study optimized the method of PET functionalization by selecting the optimal time for exposure to microwave irradiation based on the following criteria: PET temperature below the melting temperature of PET, reduction in phase separation, multiple stress creep recovery, and shear thinning behavior."
Modified Asphalt Mixtures,Waste Plastics Asphalt,"The study aimed at investigating the effect of using waste LDPE plastic as a modifier of virgin bitumen. The study also tries to amplify the advantage of using wet blending method over dry. It is viewed to use this in-hand resource to urge sustainability, enhance the stability of asphalt mix and reduce the amount of bitumen used. This chapter explores the mechanisms, methods and effects of LDPE modification on asphalt modification. The chapter concludes that LDPE modification can enhance the... and more studies are needed to optimize the design, and application of LDPE-modified asphalt... The field of LDPE- modified asphalt can advance toward more sustainable and durable pavement solutions."
Modified Asphalt Mixtures,Asphalt Pavement Piezoelectric,carbon black was first added to polyvinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene to prepare electroactive polymer modifier (epm) with high content of electroactive crystalline phases . carbon black and epm were added into asphalt to prepare asphalt-based composites containing electroactivepoly (acep) The addition of epm can slightly improve low-temperature property and thermal stability of acep. This is because the f element in epm. can interact with the polar groups in the gum and asphaltene. The 5 s. was found to be a good combination of piezoelectric and basic pavement properties and can be used to build smart asphalt pavement. This also provides a way to recycle battery waste.
