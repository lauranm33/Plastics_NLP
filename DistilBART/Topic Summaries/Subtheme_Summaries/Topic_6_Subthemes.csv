Materials Properties,Crystal Plasticity Dislocation,"Crystal Plasticity Dislocation: a crystal plasticity model for hcp materials is presented . It is based on dislocation glide and pinning. slip is assumed to occur on basal and prismatic systems, and dislocation pinning through the generation of geometrically necessary dislocations (gnds) The main effect of elastic anisotropy during subsequent plastic flow is to increase local, grain-level, accumulated slip. Lengthscale effects are shown to lead to quite considerable increases in grain-boundary stresses.
