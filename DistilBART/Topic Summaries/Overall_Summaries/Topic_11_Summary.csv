When processing, packaging and cereALS showed potential, they showed Potential to reduced environmental pressures. The best reductions can be done. The work could serve as an example for future policies for future policy makers and producers and help them. The Study could serve to help policy makers. The findings are proposed to be an example of future policies. The Findings could help policymakers and help. The research is proposed to being a guide to future policies and help policy-makers.","Agriculture - Subtheme 1: Raspberry Environmental Impacts - The main objective of this study is to evaluate how management practices affect environmental impacts and to identify efficient practices of smallholder raspberry production . The variability in environmental impacts is due, among other factors, to the different agricultural practices used and the yield obtained . This study evaluated the environmental impact of cultivation of five swedish pulses (yellow peas, grey peas, faba beans, fab a beans, common beans and lentils) in a life-cycle perspective. The impact of imported pulses in sweden. In general, pulses and cereals showed potential to reduce environmental pressures, despite low per-hectare. When processing, packaging and cereALS showed potential. When they were used, they showed Potential to reduced environmental pressures. when processing,.
Agriculture - Subtheme 2: Produce Sustainable Food - The continuous intensification of iua could lead to a second green revolution, which aims to meet the current and future food demand . The production and supply of food currently accounts for 20 30% of greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions in the uk . This study used environmental life cycle assessment (lca) to quantify potential savings of food-related ghg emissions that may be achieved. The greatest reductions can be achieved by selecting the right crops. The biggest reductions could be achieved in the right crop. The best reductions can also be done. The study. can be. be. to be achieved, and the greatest reductions of. the right seeds and the best crops can be made. The research questions that lca can be.
Agriculture - Subtheme 3: Cycle Olive Cultivation - The study was carried out through an energy, economic and environmental analysis . The main sustainable features include the use of treated urban wastewater for drip irrigation and the exploitation of environmentally friendly techniques aimed to preserve/maintain soil quality . The study aimed to bridge this gap by evaluating the environmental performance of an urban vertical, indoor farm through life-cycle assessment. The results obtained have enabled up to 59 practices to be brought to light. The findings are proposed as a guide to future policies. The study has been proposed to be a guide for future policies for the. to be. and. the. and a guide. to future Policies for certain ce practices. The research is proposed. The work aims to help policy makers and producers and help them.
Agriculture - Subtheme 4: Crops Life Cycle - The main objective of this study is to assess the impact of frozen green bean production and processing . The study was conducted following iso 14040 and 14044 on life cycle assessment (lca) and product rules for arable crops v. 2.0.0 . The analysis shows how solution a has a lower impact on adp fossil, gWP 100yr, odp, mep, pcop, ap and ep from 0.04% to 11% to 10%. The study shows the only information available in the only limited information in literature available in literature. The analysis conducted shows the impact has been at industry processing plant with average technology. The results for frozen green beans have been at medium-sized plants with average.
Agriculture - Subtheme 5: Impacts Organic Rice - Impacts Organic Rice: earlier applications of the life cycle assessment (lca) to organic agriculture concern comparisons with conventional agriculture . In this study, time-series data obtained from a five-year on-farm trial were applied to an lca of three rice production systems in japan . Four impact categories: global warming, acidification, eutrophication, and non-renewable energy were used. The results showed that only the environmental impacts of organic farming fluctuated widely over the years. The findings showed that the results showed. only the Environmental impacts of Organic farming fluctued widely over. the results show that only these fluctuations diminished over time, and these fluctuations reduced over time. The study could serve as an example for future studies.
Agriculture - Subtheme 6: Tomatoes Environmental Impacts - Tomatoes Environmental Impacts: the environmental impact of imported fresh agricultural products, such as off-season vegetables transported over long distances, is under growing scrutiny . We hypothesised that the life cycle assessment (lca) ranking between local and imported vegetables might change depending on the impact category considered . We found that the moroccan tomato water consumption highly contributed to the total damages to human health (14%) and ecosystems (20% (contribution to resources depletion was only 2%) The higher level of artificialisation of the french production resulted in greater impacts. The higherLevel of artificialisations of the French production resulted on total energy consumption, global warming, and eutrophication, even including transport to france for the morOCcan tomato.
Agriculture - Subtheme 7: Food Losses Harvesting - The paper analyzes the possibility that economically significant losses may be occurring at the farm and wholesale levels in two cases that have drawn attention in the near east and north africa . In egypt, local experts have focused on large post-harvest losses of tomatoes, an important crop, largely produced by small-scale farmers . The paper discusses whether mung bean is a low-impact option for protein production. The paper also discusses whethermung beans is a high-cost option. The study also explores potential strategies to mitigate these losses to mitigateThese losses. The results show that the on-farm production of mung beans are. and the energy-water-food security (ewfs) nexus and the environmental impact of this crop.
Agriculture - Subtheme 8: Water Depending Production - The water footprint of 1kg of barilla pasta has been shown to range between 1.336 and 2.847l of water . This paper analyses the water footprint (wf) for 1l of gazpacho, a chilled vegetable soup produced by an agrifood company . Most of the wf comes from green water (69%), 23% from blue and 8% represents the grey water. pollution due to micropollutants, which are not yet regulated, has been taken into account. If the afforestation project was located in the sususus. The study was designed to act as carbon sinks, the remaining environmental issues are usually overlooked, with the potential risk of shifting environmental burdens.
Agriculture - Subtheme 9: Cashew Cropping Systems - The environmental issues related to the main production systems and products commercialized by brazilian farms have not been discussed consistently . This environmental assessment is important to guide the efforts of researchers and farmers for improving the environmental performance of cashew cropping systems . The study advances the knowledge base on the environmental assessment of perennial crops in general, and on cashew crops specifically. The best option to improve the environmental impact is to adjust the high-input system. The research is to change the low- input system. to the low and full production system, and to improve. the best option is to make it more efficient and to reduce the environmental impacts of the high and low- inputs of the cashew and other products that are produced in this study.
Agriculture - Subtheme 10: Sustainability Wine Sector - Sustainability Wine Sector: environmental sustainability in the wine sector has become a priority, as a result of both the growing interest in environmental issues and the consumer's demand for more information about the environmental impact of the products they purchase . The study provides inventory data on wine production systems from 18 wineries located in major wine-producing regions in spain and the south of france. The results show a major contribution of the winery phase. The study shows a major contributions to the winemaking sector. The findings show a significant contribution to the corporate carbon footprint of the vineyard. The authors say that with the establishment of best practices and with optimized resource consumption, the company's carbon footprint values can be reduced by almost 25%. The study.",100
