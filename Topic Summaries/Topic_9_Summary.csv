In the present work eco-friendly composites with recycled polypropylene (rpp) matrix incorporated with geopolymer concrete waste particles, wither plain (GCw) or surface-modified with oleic acid (agc) were investigated. The present study explores the possible solutions for managing such material. The current study will be useful to the business visionaries / analysts to design a suitable process to design. The concept addresses the concept of making wood-plastic composites. Using the material based on the formaldehyde-based formaldehyde, urea formaldehyde and the single-plywood.
Green Polymer Composites - Subtheme 4: Recycle Carbon Fibre - Recycle Carbon Fibre: along with the massive application of the carbon fiber reinforced polymer (cfrp), the quantity of cfrp wastes are rapidly increasing, becoming an urgent issue to be resolved . The resin matrix composed of tetra-functional epoxy/aromatic amine system which is widely used in aircraft components can be decomposed rapidly in kcl/zncl2 molten salts due to triggered c-n bond cleavage. This can facilitate the removal of pyrolysis carbon. The reclaimed fibers had similar chemical structure and graphitization degree to the commercial fibers, and also the tensile strength retention rate was up to 97.8%. The reclaimed carbon fibers showed a comparable reinforcing effect for the polypropylene in comparison.
Green Polymer Composites - Subtheme 5: Biodegradation Process Composites - thermoplastic cassava starch (tpcs) is a promising alternative material to replace the non-biodegradable petroleum based polymer due to its good environmental-friendly aspect . However, tpcs have some limitation such as poor mechanical properties . In the present study, cogon grass fibre (cgf) were incorporated into tpCS using compression molding. Then the fundamental properties of cfg/tpcs biopolymer composites were carried out in order to evaluate their potential as a biodegradables. The incorporation of cgf and tpc. was found to have improved their potential to be a Biodegradative reinforcement. In the study it was found that, the incorporation ofcfg has improved the.
Green Polymer Composites - Subtheme 6: Fibreglass Glassfibre Composites - In the 1950s, glass fibre-reinforced polyester resin (grp, also known as fibreglass or glassfibre) composites replaced wood and metal as the material for small recreational and work boats . Many vessels have now reached end-of-life (eol) and become abandoned or derelict vessels (adv) given that thermosetting resin is not easy to recycle, these boats exist as slowly rotting hulks. There is a growing cohort of stakeholders. There are a growing group of stakeholders from various backgrounds becoming concerned about this issue. The study shows for the first time that this problem can be avoided by using c/ c/c-sic based on a novel short fiber cf/peek fiber hybrid.
Green Polymer Composites - Subtheme 7: Mechanical Properties Biocomposite - Biocomposite materials are prepared by blending natural rubber (nr) and polylactic acid (pla) reinforced with rubberwood sawdust (rws) This study aimed to investigate the effects of pla grade, nr/pla blend ratio, and rws content on flexure, tension, hardness, and water absorption characteristics, including thermal stability. The rwscontent significantly affected the physical and mechanical properties of the biocomposites. The increasing additions of rws from 30 to 50 wt% increased the mechanical modulus, hardness and water absorbed. The added rws increased the Mechanical modulus and waterabsorment but decreased the thermal stability of thebiocompositites. Biocompositing materials.
