Packaging,Produce Eutectogel Properties,"Ten different eutectogels were successfully synthesized using durian seed gum (dsg) and xanthan gum (xg) gelators at different composition (5, 10, 15 %) to gel choline chloride-glucose (1:1), choline-fructose (1,2) and betaine- glucose-water (1.1) nadess. Results revealed that eutECTogel was non-newtonian and weak gel material. When the gum content increased, the resulted eutectionogel. showed higher viscosity, yield stress, hardness and gumminess, adhesiveness, and weight holding capacity. This eutectorogel.

Packaging,Maintenance Jujube Fruit,"The effects of carnauba wax and cw containing glycerol monolaurate (cw-gml) coating on physico-chemical and qualitative attributes of jujube fruit are investigated during storage at 20 c for 12 days . The coatings reduced the respiration rate, inhibited ethylene synthesis and slowed the ripening process. The two coatings also delay the change of skin color and ensure higher content of chlorophyll and ascorbic acid. After 12 days. after 12 d of the fruit, the decay index is only 44.3% of the jujubes. The results confirm that cw-suspective. The main benefits were the reduction in mass loss, maintenance of green color.

Packaging,Biodegradable Polymers Nanoscale,"Biodegradable Polymers Nanoscale: The replacement of synthetic plastics with biodegradables is a challenge of high societal importance . We report a class of high-performance multifunctional composite films made of nano- and microscale reinforced naturally sourced biopolymers. These films are made of an agarose matrix reinforced with hierarchically branched soft dendritic colloids (sdcs) from chitosan. The results suggest a universal strategy. The reinforced composite has excellent performance with more than 4 higher toughness than non-reinforced agaros. The composite has more than four times higher toughness. The material has better toughness thanNon-re Inventors and improved hydrostability and remarkable bactericidal activity.
