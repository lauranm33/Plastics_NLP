Recycled Aggregate - Subtheme 2: Recycling Waste Concrete - The study aims to investigate the impact of (i) concrete categories, (ii) methods to model recycling, and (iii) using renewable energy sources on the material footprint in concrete recycling . The results highlight that the concrete recycling system can reduce 99% of the emf and 66-93% of fmf compared with the baseline system, in which concrete waste is landfilled. All three recycling modeling approaches indicate that concrete recycling can considerably reduce emf. The results show that concrete recycle can significantly reduce e-waste and fmF and f mf. Using alternative diesels is more sensitive. using alternativediesels are more sensitive than adopting renewable electricity in reduction of the fmmf in concrete. The paper suggests that the.

The results show that the coated pozz.
Recycled Aggregate - Subtheme 4: Carbonation Recycled Concrete - Carbonation Recycled Concrete: during the demolition and recycling process the specific surface area per volume of concrete is significantly increased . The accelerated carbonation leads to the formation of calcium carbonate and decalcified calcium-silicate-hydrate (c-s-h) present in patches on the surface of rca particles. Using slurry instead of tap water decreases concrete flow and generally increases compressive strength. Using carbonated instead of uncarbonated rca leads to a faster decrease of flow. The higher strength offered the potential to decrease the clinker content of the recycling concrete. In a study, the higher strength linked to the use of carbonated rCA offers the potential. The results showed that replacing cement with cg powder.
Recycled Aggregate - Subtheme 5: Aggregate Recycled Concrete - recycled concrete has been emerging as a sustainable solution to warrant the reduction of construction wastes, as well as to prevent the depletion of natural resources from growing construction demand . In particular, little research was done on the combined effects of recycled aggregates and fly ash, popularly used as a partial substitution of cement . The study investigates the effects of such factors on the mechanical and durability properties of recycled aggregate concrete. In general, the higher ratio of recycled Aggregate concrete. The use of fly ash improved the flowability of. recycled aggregate and fly Ash. The results showed that the higher receiving researable and recycled in-separation of recovery and referred.

This paper could help reduce the disposal and conversion of.
Recycled Aggregate - Subtheme 7: Recycling Waste Bauxite - Recycling Waste Bauxite: recycling waste bauxite tailings to prepare foam concrete (fc) is a practical approach to achieve its comprehensive management . There are fewer studies concerning the durability performance of fc under different bt contents and dry and wet (d-w) cycling environments in the existing studies .

The results showed that. the results demonstrated. the durability coefficients in water and sulfate environments were 87.54 % and 77.94 % in water.54% and 77%. The results indicated that bt reduced the hydration products of fC and impaired the pore structure, leading to a reduction.
Recycled Aggregate - Subtheme 8: Ready Mixed Concrete - The study investigates the effects of extending the discharge time on the properties of fresh and hardened ready-mixed concrete . Fresh concrete properties included air content, slump, and temperature, while hardened concrete properties encompassed compressive strength, freeze-thaw resistance, and surface resistivity .
