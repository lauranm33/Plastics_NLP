Biodegradation,Edible Insects Nutritional,"edible insects are considered as traditional foods in over 100 countries of asia, africa, and south america . edible insects supply amounts of protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals comparable to those of meat . The use of insects in animal feed has the potential to reduce the demand for soybean production and reduce the deforestation and loss of natural resources. In particular, the black soldier fly (bsf, hermetia illucens) larvae have received attention due to their ability to convert organic waste. The use to turn organic waste into high-value biomass. commingled waste has neither calorific value. Commingled Waste has neithercalorific. value enough to support waste-to-energy operations nor is it suitable.

Biodegradation,Pineapple Waste Vermicomposting,"The study compared the efficiency of waste reduction and nutrient recovery for batch (b), and continuous (c) vermicomposting systems during a 60-day period . Results indicated that waste degradation was 60%, and 54% while earthworm biomass increased by 57% and 129% for bpw, andcpw, respectively. continuous systems produced higher earthworm Biocom. The study found that the. continuous systems produced more nutrients in vermicomomposts. and retained more nutrients. The results indicated that. and the researment of the biocomposted systems produced and more nutrients and more nutrients, and can therefore, be recommended as better systems for pineapple waste vermic.

Biodegradation,Wetland Domestic Wastewater,"The performance of the grow system was monitored from november 2013 to april 2015 in treating greywater from the krishna student hostel in iit madras . The system was fed with greywater at a flow rate of 62, 70, 82, 100 and 120l/day respectively . The reusable effluent water is named green water The reuse of animal manure without treatment can be harmful to the environment. The reusable water is called 'green water' and is named. The usepa is named 'greenwater . The study is called Green Water and the reusable effulent water is known as green water and the water is name green water.

Biodegradation,Restored Wetland Soils,"Restored Wetland Soils: Wetland restoration efforts aim to enhance the structure and function of degraded and damaged wetlands . We found that increasing clay content of restored soils caused a marginal reduction in the total amount of c partitioned as co2 and ch4, while the nutrient-rich plant, p. virginica, emitted more co2. The findings raised questions about whether it will be feasible to understand to understand the interspecies of interspecies. plants and diversity and the biological biology and the biotic behaviour and biologists in the environmental relationship of plants and their biologics and their.

Biodegradation,Induce Pest,"Bemisia tabaci is a virus vector in tropical environments (central america and the caribbean) It is based upon how to take advantage of our knowledge of b. tabaci behavior to develop preventative, environment-friendly, and cost-effective tactics . Some of these methods are also applicable to large greenhouse facilities . The research is necessary to determine its compatibility with other strategies for controlling nesidiocoris tenuis and other pest programs. The results suggest that b. bassiana jef-350 could be effectively used to control the. tenuus. 10uis. and other strategies. tomato and tenui pests, but other innovations have been traditionally less effective, but have not been traditionally grown from.

Biodegradation,Wastewater Treated Wetlands,"The aim of this article is to evaluate if domestic wastewater treated by various wetland systems can be successfully recycled to irrigate commercial crops such as chilli (capsicum annuum) grown in compost within a laboratory environment to obtain a cultivar adapted to domestic wastewater . The aim was to assess the irrigation water for long-term growth when applying recycled wastewater, the impact of various wastewaters. The study also assessed the impact and impact of treated wastewater volume for irrigation and the economic return of different experimental set-ups. The vertical-flow wetlands treated domestic wastewater. The results showed high values significantly (p < 0.05.05) treaty-to-treated wastewater. well, meeting the irrigation.

Biodegradation,Struvite Biomineralization Ecologically,"Struvite Biomineralization is an ecologically sound technology, adept at the efficient recovery and recycling of phosphorus from wastewater . However, the biomineralisation process is often perturbed by the presence of antibiotics, notably tetracycline (tc), which has not been elucidated . This study examines the efficacy of bacillus cereus lb-9 in struvite biominalization, focusing on the precipitates' composition, morphology, and tc content. The findings indicate that tc retards the initial formation of struvites. However, at concentrations below 10 mg/l tc concentrations, tc enhanced struvITE production (0.38g) by stimulating lb-8.38G) by stimulated lb- 9.

Biodegradation,Chlamydospores Per Grain,"Chlamydospores Per Grain: experiments to evaluate the potential ability of the nematode-trapping fungus duddingtonia flagrans (isolate cg768) to prey on the ancylostoma spp. The results showed that d. flagrans could present some potential to be used as a non-chemotherapeutic. alternative for regulation of ancy lostoma sipp. populations in the environment.

Biodegradation,Recycled Fe Phosphates,"Recycled Fe Phosphates: iron (fe) minerals are commonly used to remove phosphorus (p) from waste streams, producing p-loaded fe(iii) oxides or fe(ii) phosphate minerals (e.g., vivianite) These minerals may be used as fertilizers to enhance p circularity if solubilized in soil . The study found that prolonged soil flooding and organic matter addition can enhance the p fertilizer efficiency of feps. The redox potential did not decrease to -200 mv by flooding for a brief period (13 d) during the pot trial. It can be concluded that prolonged and organic Matter addition can also enhance the fep. application of fep in powder form may enhance p."
